2. Instance and Object
when you create an object from a class, you are said to be creating an instance of that class.
when we say "instance of the Express application," we are referring to an object created from the express function.

3. Referencing an object
When we say a variable is "referencing" an object, it means that the variable holds a reference to the memory location where an object is stored.
