1. dotenv

loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. 

dotenv module itself does not have any external dependencies. Therefore it is a zero-dependency module.
A "zero-dependency" module is one that doesn't require any other external modules or packages to be installed for it to work correctly.

2. asyncHandler from 'express-async-handler'
